    "text": "Nothing should prevent you from communicating your ideas and you should not lose the opportunity to put into words what you want to convey. The writing proposals we offer apply to short texts in varied platforms (social networks, websites, magazines, photo albums, among others) and to fiction and nonfiction texts as part of a ghostwriting project. The latter involves face-to-face and/or virtual meetings to collect all the material, a planning stage to define structural and style elements and a writing process that includes partial presentations until we reach the final version of the text.",
    "text2":"Tell us what you are looking for",
    "text3":"Texts are delivered in digital format but the proposal can also include the design and printing of the book."
